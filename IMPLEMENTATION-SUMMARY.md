# Multi-Tenant Implementation Summary

## Overview

OpenWord has been enhanced to support **true multi-tenancy**, allowing multiple churches/organizations to use the same infrastructure with isolated data, custom branding, and organization-specific QR codes.

## What Was Already Implemented âœ…

Good news! Much of the multi-tenant architecture was already in place:

1. **Database Layer** (`db/churches.js`, `db/services.js`)
   - Functions to fetch church data by `church_key`
   - Functions to manage services linked to churches
   - Row Level Security (RLS) support

2. **API Endpoints** (`src/server.js`)
   - `GET /church/info?church=KEY` - Fetch church configuration (line 342)
   - `GET /api/church/profile` - Auth user's church profile (line 581)
   - Service management endpoints (start/stop)

3. **Client Church Loading** (`pages/index.js`)
   - Fetches church data using `?church=` parameter (line 68)
   - Displays church-specific branding and languages

4. **QR Code Generation** (`src/services/qrcode.js`)
   - Generates QR codes with church key and service ID (line 10)

## What Was Added/Fixed âœ¨

### 1. Database Schema Documentation
**File**: `transcript-translate-server/supabase-schema.sql`

Complete SQL migration file with:
- `churches` table definition with all branding fields
- `services` table linked to churches
- `sessions` table for analytics
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data isolation
- Indexes for performance
- Helper functions for common queries
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

### 2. Enhanced Control Panel
**File**: `OpenWordClient/pages/control.js`

Added QR code generation and display:
- Automatically generates QR code on page load
- Displays QR code with church-specific branding
- Download button for QR code image
- Copy button for participant URL
- Shows full participant URL: `?church=CHURCH_KEY&serviceId=SERVICE_ID`

**Lines modified**: 17-21, 37-94, 257-341

### 3. Control Panel Styles
**File**: `OpenWordClient/styles/Control.module.css`

Added CSS for QR code section:
- `.qrSection` - Container layout
- `.qrCodeContainer` - QR code display with dashed border
- `.qrCodeImage` - Styled QR code image
- `.downloadButton` - Download QR code button
- `.urlDisplay`, `.urlBox`, `.urlInput`, `.copyButton` - URL display and copy
- Responsive styles for mobile devices

**Lines added**: 348-504

### 4. Comprehensive Deployment Guide
**File**: `MULTI-TENANT-SETUP.md`

Complete guide covering:
- Architecture overview with diagrams
- Step-by-step Supabase setup
- Render (server) deployment
- Vercel (client) deployment
- Church onboarding process
- Testing multi-tenancy
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Production checklist
- Maintenance procedures

### 5. Updated Documentation
**File**: `CLAUDE.md`

Enhanced with:
- Multi-tenancy overview
- Database schema information
- Multi-tenant workflows
- URL structure documentation
- Key files for multi-tenancy
- Environment variables explanation

**Lines modified**: Multiple sections throughout

## Architecture Flow

```
User visits: https://yourapp.com?church=NEFC&serviceId=1234
                              â†“
Client fetches: GET /church/info?church=NEFC
                              â†“
Server queries Supabase: SELECT * FROM churches WHERE church_key = 'NEFC'
                              â†“
Returns church data: logo, colors, languages, greetings
                              â†“
Client displays church-specific branding and translation options
                              â†“
User selects language and joins: Socket.IO room "1234:spanish"
                              â†“
Translation streams to all clients in room
```

## Testing the Changes

### Step 1: Apply Database Schema

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open `transcript-translate-server/supabase-schema.sql`
4. Copy and paste the entire file
5. Click **Run**

### Step 2: Create Test Church

```sql
-- Create a test church in Supabase
INSERT INTO churches (
  user_id,
  name,
  church_key,
  greeting,
  message,
  translation_languages,
  default_service_id,
  host_language
) VALUES (
  'YOUR_USER_UUID_HERE',  -- Get from auth.users table
  'Test Church',
  'TEST',
  'Welcome to Test Church!',
  '["Real-time translation available", "Choose your language below"]'::jsonb,
  '[
    {"value": "es", "label": "Spanish"},
    {"value": "fr", "label": "French"}
  ]'::jsonb,
  '1234',
  'en-US'
);
```

### Step 3: Test Client

Visit: `http://localhost:3000?church=TEST&serviceId=1234`

You should see:
- "Welcome to Test Church!" greeting
- Custom messages
- Spanish and French as available languages

### Step 4: Test Control Panel

1. Log in at: `http://localhost:3000/control`
2. You should see:
   - Church information card with "TEST" as the church key
   - QR code automatically generated
   - Participant URL with church key
   - Copy and Download buttons

### Step 5: Test QR Code

1. Download the QR code from control panel
2. Scan with phone camera
3. Should open: `https://yourapp.com?church=TEST&serviceId=1234`
4. Verify correct church branding appears

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] **Database**
  - [ ] Apply `supabase-schema.sql` to production Supabase
  - [ ] Create test church and verify isolation
  - [ ] Test RLS policies (users can only see their own data)

- [ ] **Server (Render)**
  - [ ] Set `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
  - [ ] Set `DEBABEL_CLIENT_APP` to Vercel URL
  - [ ] Upload `google-api-credentials.json` as Secret File
  - [ ] Deploy and test `/church/info?church=TEST` endpoint

- [ ] **Client (Vercel)**
  - [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_NAME` to Render URL
  - [ ] Deploy and test `?church=TEST&serviceId=1234`
  - [ ] Verify QR code generation in control panel

- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Create 2+ test churches with different keys
  - [ ] Verify data isolation (each sees only their data)
  - [ ] Test simultaneous services from different churches
  - [ ] Test QR code scanning on mobile devices
